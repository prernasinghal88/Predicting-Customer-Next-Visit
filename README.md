# Predicting-Customer-Next-Visit
We have the data of customers and their history of 1000 days visiting a mall. We have to predict the day of next visit for each customer.


Here we have a dataset with 300k rows.
Each row represents a customer and with that we have a specific customer Information
We are provided the days the customer has visited the shopping mall in the span of 1000 days

As a business problem we have to predict on which weekday the customer will visit the mall in the week following the 1000th day.
Solving this problem will help the organisation to design the promotion packages for the target customers.
